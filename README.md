# River Pollution Monitoring App

## Overview
The River Pollution Monitoring App is a mobile application designed to address the issue of river pollution in Pune, India. It empowers volunteers to monitor water quality, raise awareness, and advocate for sustainable solutions to preserve and protect rivers Pawana and Indrayani.

## Problem Statement
Rivers in Pune are facing unprecedented pollution from various sources, leading to adverse impacts on human health, ecosystems, and communities relying on these water bodies.

## Solution
